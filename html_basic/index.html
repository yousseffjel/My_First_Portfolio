                <h1>Overview of HTML</h1>
                <p>HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the language used to describe the structure of documents which are meant to be displayed on the web. To this effect, any content that you see on a website has some HTML code behind it.</p>
                <p>When you are asked to write a formal letter to your boss, which tool or software will you use to write the letter? You might have answered “Microsoft Word or Google Docs”. These tools are referred to as Word processors to text editors. The are meant to be used to write text like letters, etc.</p>
                <p>In the same way, we need a tool that will allow us to write for the web. If I want to create a website and structure the content on it in my own way using HTML, where then will I write the code? Similarly, we use tools that you can call Code Editors. Some common examples of these code editors include:</p>

                <h2>How to use Elements and Attributes in your HTML code</h2>
                <p>Now that we know about tags, let’s explore more about elements and attributes and how they appear in our HTML code. Remember, an element in HTML is like a block or a piece of a puzzle that makes up part of our webpage. Each element has a specific job, whether it’s to display text, link to another page, show an image, and so on.</p>

                <h3>What is an Element?</h3>
                <p>
                    An element is made up of several parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the opening tag,</li>
                        <li>the content, and</li>
                        <li>the closing tag.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For example, a simple text element looks like this:
                    <code><p>This is a paragraph.</p></code>
                </p>
                <p>Here, <em>&lt;p&gt;</em> is the opening tag that starts the element, This is a paragraph. is the content that the element displays, and <em>&lt;/p&gt;</em> is the closing tag that ends the element.</p>
                <p>The whole thing together, from the opening tag to the closing tag, is called an element.</p>
